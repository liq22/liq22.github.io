# üëã About Me

I am a **Ph.D. student** in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at **Tsinghua University**, supervised by Prof. [Zhaoye Qin](https://www.me.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1127/1763.htm). My previous experiences include:

- *Apr 2022 - Sep 2022*, Research intern at **AIR, Tsinghua University**, supervised by [Yuanchun Li](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1046/1195.htm).
- *Sep 2019 - Jun 2022*, M.Eng. in **Control Theory and Control Engineering** at Soochow University (SUDA), supervised by [Prof. Liang Chen](http://jdxy.suda.edu.cn/d1/f2/c14011a446962/page.htm) and [Prof. Changqing Shen](http://web.suda.edu.cn/cqshen/).
- *Sep 2015 - Jun 2019*, B.Eng. in **Electrical Engineering** at SUDA.

My research interests lie in the intersection of **trustworthy AI** and **reliable prognostic and health management (PHM)**. I have published numerous papers in top-tier international AI conferences. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>470+</span></strong></a>. Feel free to reach out for collaboration opportunities!
